To fix this, meticulously review the third-party library's documentation for specific installation instructions and compatibility requirements.  Ensure all necessary native modules are correctly linked (if applicable) by following platform-specific instructions (Android and iOS).  Check for any conflicting dependencies in your `package.json` file. Use a version manager like `nvm` or `pnpm` to manage Node.js and npm versions to avoid conflicts. A clean build process might help.  If problems persist, search for relevant issues on the library's GitHub repository or consider creating an issue to report the problem.  For example, if you are using a library that requires native modules, you need to perform the linking procedure following the instructions provided in the library documentation.  Always make sure to follow the updated instructions.
