This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive bug in React Native development involving third-party library integration. The bug manifests as cryptic build errors or runtime crashes that are difficult to debug due to insufficient error messages. The solution involves carefully verifying library installation, checking for compatibility issues, and ensuring proper linking of native modules if necessary.  The code examples showcase both the problematic setup and a corrected implementation.
